This term describes China’s unexpected development trajectory that defies conventional wisdom and traditional models of political transformation. While “Black Swan” events are typically used to describe unpredictable outcomes, China’s case is termed a “Red Swan” due to the continued dominance of revolutionary red in the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) flag and political symbolism.</p> <p>The “red swan” of China’s reform and economic progress, in the context of stagnation or collapse of other socialist regimes, may be attributed to the breadth, depth, and duration of its policy experiments. A recent paper by Shaoda Wang from the University of Chicago and David Yang from Harvard University has documented and analyzed over 650 policy experiments in China since 1980.</p> <p>The study reveals a remarkable system: since the 1980s, the Chinese government has been systematically trying out policies – from carbon emission trading to tax reforms – in selected localities before deciding whether to implement them nationally. Through comprehensive analysis of 652 policy experiments initiated by 92 central ministries over four decades, Wang and Yang uncover fascinating patterns in how these experiments are conducted and evaluated.</p> <p>The study documents three facts about China’s policy experimentation.</p> <ul> <li>First, policy experimentation sites are positively selected for characteristics such as local socioeconomic conditions.</li> <li>Second, the experimental situation during policy experimentation is unrepresentative. When participating in policy experiments, local politicians allocated significantly more resources to ensure the experiments’ success.</li> <li>Third, the central government showed limited sophistication in interpreting experimentation outcomes. They often failed to fully account for both the positive selection of sites and the strategic behavior of local officials.</li> </ul> <p>What stood out to me in this research was its use of the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) methodology.The DiD approach allowed the researchers to establish robust causal links between China’s policy experiments and their observed outcomes.</p> <p>First, let me explain the fundamental logic of DiD and why it’s particularly suitable for this research. DiD is designed to estimate causal effects by comparing changes over time between a treatment group and a control group. The key assumption is that without treatment, both groups would have followed parallel trends. The “difference in differences” comes from subtracting two differences:</p> <ol> <li>The difference in outcomes before and after treatment in the treatment group</li> <li>The difference in outcomes before and after treatment in the control group</li> </ol> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-11 col-lg-10"> <figure class="figure"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project/did/did_1.png" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project/did/did_1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Parallel-Trend Assumption" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">Parallel-Trend Assumption</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Source: <a href="https://medium.com/bukalapak-data/difference-in-differences-8c925e691fff" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Keisha (2022)</a></p> <p>In Wang and Yang’s study, they apply this methodology in several sophisticated ways:</p> <p>Basic DiD Implementation:</p> <ul> <li>Treatment group: Localities selected as experimentation sites</li> <li>Control group: Non-selected localities</li> <li>Treatment timing: The start of policy experiments</li> <li>Outcome variables: Local economic indicators (primarily GDP growth and fiscal revenue)</li> </ul> <p>The authors go beyond basic DiD by employing a triple-differences approach to examine how local politicians allocate resources during experiments.</p> <p>A triple-differences approach extends the logic of difference-in-differences (DiD) by adding a third dimension of comparison. While DiD compares changes between two groups over two time periods, DDD adds another layer of comparison that helps isolate the true policy effect more precisely. Let me break this down with Wang and Yang’s specific example: Their Triple-Differences Setup:</p> <ul> <li>First Difference: Time (Before vs. After experiment)</li> <li>Second Difference: Location (Experimentation vs. Non-experimentation sites)</li> <li>Third Difference: Policy Domain (Targeted vs. Non-targeted policy areas)</li> </ul> <h1 id="a-brief-introduction-to-difference-in-differences-did">A Brief Introduction to Difference-in-Differences (DiD)</h1> <p>Difference-in-Differences (DiD) is a widely used econometric method for evaluating causal effects in observational studies, particularly when randomized controlled trials are infeasible. It is especially valuable in social sciences for analyzing the impact of policy changes, interventions, or events by comparing outcomes across treated and control groups before and after the intervention.</p> <p>The core idea of DiD is simple: it leverages two dimensions of variation—time and group membership—to estimate a causal effect. Here’s a breakdown of the key components:</p> <ul> <li>Treatment group: The group exposed to the intervention or change.</li> <li>Control group: The group unaffected by the intervention, serving as a baseline.</li> <li>Pre-treatment period: The time before the intervention occurs.</li> <li>Post-treatment period: The time after the intervention is implemented.</li> </ul> <p>DiD assumes that in the absence of the treatment, the difference in outcomes between the treatment and control groups would have remained constant over time. This is called the <strong>parallel trends assumption.</strong></p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-11 col-lg-10"> <figure class="figure"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/project/did/did_2.png" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/project/did/did_2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Parallel-Trend Assumption" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">A Graph Where the Prior Trends Test Looks Good for DID, and a Graph Where It Doesn’t</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Source: <a href="https://theeffectbook.net/ch-DifferenceinDifference.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Huntington-Klein</a></p> <h3 id="mathematical-representation">Mathematical Representation</h3> <p>Let’s denote:</p> <ul> <li>\(Y_{it}\): Outcome variable for group \(i\) at time \(t\).</li> <li>\(D_i\): Indicator for whether a group is in the treatment group (\(D_i = 1\)) or control group (\(D_i = 0\)).</li> <li>\(T_t\): Indicator for whether the observation is in the post-treatment period (\(T_t = 1\)) or pre-treatment period (\(T_t = 0\)).</li> </ul> <p>The basic DiD regression model can be written as:</p> \[Y_{it} = \alpha + \beta D_i + \gamma T_t + \delta (D_i \times T_t) + \epsilon_{it}\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>\(\alpha\): Baseline outcome for the control group in the pre-treatment period.</li> <li>\(\beta\): Baseline difference between the treatment and control groups.</li> <li>\(\gamma\): Common time trend affecting both groups.</li> <li>\(\delta\): <strong>DiD estimate</strong>, capturing the treatment effect.</li> <li>\(\epsilon_{it}\): Error term.</li> </ul> <p>The interaction term \(D_i \times T_t\) isolates the causal effect of the treatment by comparing the change in outcomes over time between the treatment and control groups.</p> <h3 id="key-assumptions">Key Assumptions</h3> <ol> <li> <strong>Parallel Trends Assumption</strong>: In the absence of treatment, the treated and control groups would follow the same trend over time.</li> <li> <strong>No Anticipation</strong>: The treatment does not affect outcomes before its implementation.</li> <li> <strong>Stable Composition</strong>: The treatment and control groups remain comparable over time.</li> </ol> <h1 id="applications-of-did-in-journalism-and-communication-studies">Applications of DiD in Journalism and Communication Studies</h1> <p>DiD has significant potential for Journalism and Communication research, particularly for evaluating the effects of policy shifts, media interventions, or events on information dissemination, audience behavior, or media environments.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Policy Impact on Media Representation</strong>: For example, a study could examine how a new censorship policy in one region affects the tone or volume of media coverage compared to regions not subject to the policy.</li> <li> <strong>Digital Interventions</strong>: A researcher could analyze how introducing a fact-checking feature on a social media platform impacts misinformation spread, comparing the platform before and after the intervention to a similar platform without such a feature.</li> <li> <strong>Audience Behavior Studies</strong>: DiD can evaluate how events like major news outlet closures influence news consumption patterns in affected versus unaffected regions.</li> </ul> <p>By isolating causal effects, DiD allows researchers in Journalism and Communication studies to move beyond correlation, offering robust insights into how policies and interventions shape media systems and audience dynamics.</p> <p>Here are some examples.</p> <h2 id="the-influence-of-media-ownership-on-political-reporting">The Influence of Media Ownership on Political Reporting</h2> <p>Archer, Allison M., and Joshua Clinton. 2017. “Changing Owners, Changing Content: Does Who Owns the News Matter for the News?” Political Communication 35 (3): 353–70. doi:10.1080/10584609.2017.1375581.</p> <p>The article investigates the impact of Rupert Murdoch’s 2007 acquisition of The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on its political content coverage, particularly compared to The New York Times (NYT), using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) design.

In the elections leading up to the local newspaper exit (-2 and -1), the figure shows that the treatment counties (those that experienced an exit) and the control counties (those that did not) were following very similar trajectories in terms of both electoral polarization and small party vote share. The effect estimates for the election immediately following the local newspaper exit (labeled 1) show a clear increase in both electoral polarization and small party vote share in the treatment counties relative to the control counties.
